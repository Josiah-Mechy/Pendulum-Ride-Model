# Pendulum-Ride-Model
Designed and built a scale model of a pendulum amusement ride using dual stepper motors, a 3D-printed gondola, and custom lap bar mechanisms. The ride incorporated realistic design elements including steel support members and a concrete base to simulate real-world engineering constraints.
