*A scale model of a pendulum amusement ride, designed and built by our team.*

---
## Overview

Designed and built a scale model of a pendulum amusement ride using dual stepper motors, a 3D-printed gondola, and custom lap bar mechanisms. The ride incorporated realistic design elements including steel support members and a concrete base to simulate real-world engineering constraints.

---

## Features

- Dual stepper motor-driven swing system  
- 3D-printed pendulum gondola, seats, and lap bar restraints  
- Steel frame support with a concrete base    
- Arduino-controlled motors (with code written by team members)

---

## My Contributions

- Designed and 3D printed the gondola, seats, and lap bar system  
- Led assembly of the stepper motors
- Selected and implemented steel support beams and base materials  
- Created competition documentation
- Assisted in testing and validation of motor behavior

---

## Team Contributions

- Aaron and Stephen Dooley – Wrote and tested Arduino code for stepper motor control
- Bernard Anderson – Wired and assembled the electronics system
- Brian Earls – Assisted with CAD modeling, documentation, and model assembly
- Adrian Jones and Elliot – Assembled structural components and contributed to documentation
