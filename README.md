# Pendulum-Ride-Model-Theme-Park-Competition-Team
Designed and built a scale model of a pendulum amusement ride using dual stepper motors, a 3D-printed gondola, and custom lap bar mechanisms. The ride incorporated realistic design elements including steel support members and a concrete base to simulate real-world engineering constraints.
## My Role
- Modeled mechanical components (gondola, seats, and lap bars) in SOLIDWORKS  
- Led assembly and integration of stepper motors  
- Assisted in mechanical testing and motion evaluation

## Repository Structure
- `/cad/`: SolidWorks part and assembly files  
- `/code/`: Arduino motor control scripts and configurations  
- `/images/`: Photos and CAD renders  
- `/docs/`: Design notes and documentation

## Tools & Technologies
- SOLIDWORKS 
- FDM 3D Printing  
- Stepper Motors & Drivers
